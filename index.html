    <p id="intro">Socrates of Athens is regarded by many as one of the most important figures in the history of philosophy. The teacher of Plato, his persuit of widsom and virtue through not tradition and religion, but reason, represents a turning point in the history of ideas. In the year 399 BC he was ordered to take his own life by the city of Athens for the charge of impeity and corruption of the youth.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The philosopher Socrates remains, as he was in his lifetime (469–399 B.C.E.), an enigma, an inscrutable individual who, despite having written nothing, is considered one of the handful of philosophers who forever changed how philosophy itself was to be conceived.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Socrates conducted his philosophical activity by means of question an answer, and we typically associate with him a method called the <em>elenchus</em>.  At the same time, Plato’s Socrates calls himself a midwife—who has no ideas of his own but helps give birth to the ideas of others—and proceeds dialectically—defined either as asking questions, embracing the practice of collection and division, or proceeding from hypotheses to first principles.</p>
